# WheWheLottery

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.  

In WHE WHE Lottery app, a player must choose 5 lottery numbers and an “amount” they want to bet.  

Developed the User Interface that will allow the cashiers for the lottery ticket company to generate a customers’ ticket (ie: the UI to allow customers to select 5 numbers and assign a money value to it).  

1. By default, the CASH AND CLEAR button is disabled.  The buttons become enabled when the user selects the customer’s 5 chosen lottery numbers and their bet amount. The app prohibits the user from selecting more than 5 lottery numbers,the cashier can only choose a number ONCE.
2. Each time the cashier selects a number, the user interface updates to clearly indicate that the number has been selected.  
3. The cashier can reset their number choices by pressing the CLEAR button.  When the CLEAR is pressed, the user interface of each number button reset to its default styling.
4. In addition to selecting numbers, the cashier must assign a bet value to the customer chosen numbers. 
5. After selecting 5 lottery numbers, placing a bet amount and pressing the CASH button, the cashier prompted with a customized modal, then enter the customer’s payment, via the keypad. Then the app would automatically calculate and display the customer’s change.
